# odin-recipes
Hello! This is my first project learning web dev.

The overall goal to this site is to create a recipe list and to boost my knowledge of using HTML and Git.

---- After completion thoughts ----

This project really showed that even at the beginning when you dont feel like you understand something, you at least know you have SEEN the content and can google to remember what something is.
